# covid19 xray detection CNN model
 Detection19 based on chest xray using a CNN model

1. Dataset Pre-processing, Baseline Model, Models tested for Adapting/Fine-tuning the network
2. Transfer Learning models
3. Retrains the best fine-tuned model found in Pt1 on a combined validation + test set
4. Calculates the sensitivity, specificity and f1 score for the transfer learning model found in Pt2
