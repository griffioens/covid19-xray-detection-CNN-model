Pt1: Dataset Pre-processing, Baseline Model, Models tested for Adapting/Fine-tuning the network
Pt2: Transfer Learning models
Pt3: Retrains the best fine-tuned model found in Pt1 on a combined validation + test set
Pt4: Calculates the sensitivity, specificity and f1 score for the transfer learning model found in Pt2
